# Intelligent-things

**WARNING:** DO NOT USE THE DARKDEFENDER MILITECH GRADE SOFTWARE. IT IS FOR DEFENSE PURPOSES ONLY. IF YOU ARE HOSTILE WITH IT, IT WILL BACKFIRE.

## Overview

The `Intelligent-things` repository encompasses a suite of advanced security and encryption tools designed for high-stakes environments. This software is engineered for cutting-edge defense applications and employs sophisticated techniques, including encryption, key management, and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in conjunction with AngelNET.

## Key Components

### 1. **Instahack-HackerDefense**

This Python-based tool provides a comprehensive defense mechanism against unauthorized access and hacking attempts. It includes:

- **Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, and retrieval of encryption keys.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts and decrypts sensitive data to ensure confidentiality.
- **Zero Knowledge Proofs**: Generates and verifies proofs to enhance security and privacy.
- **Badge Management**: Updates and serves security badges dynamically.

### 2. **Dark Side Badge**

The Sith-themed badge for `Instahack-HackerDefense` highlights the tool’s secure and advanced nature. The badge is dynamically generated and reflects the latest status of the tool’s security framework.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- Flask-HTTPAuth
- Cryptography
- AngelNET

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanaknows/Intelligent-things.git
   cd Intelligent-things
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   ANGELNET_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ANGELNET_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

4. **Generate Encryption Key:**

   ```bash
   python -c "from instahack_hackerdefense import generate_key; print(generate_key().decode())"
   ```

   Save the generated key in `secret.key`.

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the Flask application:

```bash
python instahack_hackerdefense.py
```

### Endpoints

- **GET /**: Serves the security badge.
- **POST /update_badge**: Updates the security badge.
- **POST /encrypt**: Encrypts data using the provided key.
- **POST /decrypt**: Decrypts encrypted data.
- **POST /zero_knowledge_proof**: Generates a Zero Knowledge Proof.
- **POST /verify_zero_knowledge_proof**: Verifies a Zero Knowledge Proof.

### Example Requests

- **Encrypt Data:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/encrypt -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data":"your_data"}'
  ```

- **Decrypt Data:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/decrypt -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"encrypted_data":"your_encrypted_data"}'
  ```

## Security

Ensure that your API keys and encryption keys are kept secure. Regularly update your software to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
